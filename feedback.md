### Improvement points

- There is no version specified in your docker-compose file, so we did not manage to start the system "out of the box".
- Sending any value outside of an enum returns a 500 error. An error should be catched, and a 400 error should be raised.
- Adding a watch without an optional field is impossible (it should be possible).
- There is a limit of 100 elements returned by the DB. This is not in the specification (so we had to remove it to run our tests).
- The *find*, *list* and *update* endpoints are not protected against SQL injections
- Your authentication only protects POST, PUT, DELETE. The specification says it should also protect GET.
- In your *update* function, your assumption that the number of affected rows checks wether an element was updated or not is partially incorrect in this context. If you update an existing watch with the exact same data, you get 0 affected rows, so your API assumes the element doesn't exist, which is not true. You are giving a 404 error if you update a watch with the exact same value. (It's a tricky border case, but you may correct it by getting the watch before you do the update).

### Remarks

This is a good work, and your code is very compact. You can correct your code easily imo. Good job.
